# App Bundle Template

This is a skeleton for creating your own application bundles for AdaptiveScale Cloud Manager (ACM).

Clone this folder structure as a starting point for your own project.

The directory structure is as follows:
```
/bin           <-- all your scripts and executables go here
/img           <-- image assets for your app go here
/ui            <-- any custom UI elements go here
manifest.json  <-- app structure and metadata
```
